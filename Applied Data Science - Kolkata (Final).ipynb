    "In our citi of Kolkata(India), famously known as City Of Joy , there are new tourists come from different part of the world. With many historicaly significant places, there are areas in the city, which been considered as heaven for all food lovers. As kolkata is very large city and in a short stay, it could be very difficult to find these places. So I am planning to create this datascience project which will identify this food hot-spots. "
